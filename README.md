Hey! The beginning of Time is a game created by Shiku.
<br>
I made this game using what I have learned on school, so the code will be a lil' messy.
And by lil' messy, I probably mean a complete mess.
<br>
But hey, the only purpose was to learn, so if you find any way to make it better, not only the 
code but also the Game itself, Don't doubt to tell me!
<br> <br>
This game is about Karim and his two friends. Somehow, They end up finding an odd stone in a cave...
<br>
If you want to know more, play the game!!
<hr>
To play the game you just have to download it, and execute the .bat.
<br>
Since it is a game meant to be played on terminal, you will have to do this.
<br> 
(It will have a Graphic Interface though! I just need some time...)
